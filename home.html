            <h2>About Gender-Based Violence (GBV)</h2>
            <p>GBV includes physical, emotional, sexual, and economic harm based on gender. It affects millions, but speaking out is the first step to change. By sharing thoughts openly, individuals can break free from isolation, access help, and inspire others. Support includes counseling, legal aid, and community resources to rebuild lives safely.</p>
